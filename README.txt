Proprietary files for building CyanogenMod 11 for the Samsung Galaxy Player 3.6 EU/US (YP-GS1)

These are the proprietary files (camera, graphics, audio,...) which are needed to run Android 4.4.x with Linux kernel 2.6.35.7 properly.
All files stored in ./proprietary are pulled from a stock Galaxy Player 3.6 running latest update (XXMA1 - Android 2.3.6). 
We are using some drivers from the Galaxy SL (GT-i9003) and the graphics drivers from the LG Optimus Black (P970).
For more informations refer to androthan/android_device_samsung_aalto/README.txt (branch: cm-11.0).
